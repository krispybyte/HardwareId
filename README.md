# HardwareId
I had to make this for my loader project regardless, so although it's basic, I decided it could be helpful for some people, this project uses the windows [WMI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page "Microsoft Documentation") SDK to retrieve hardware information about the machine.
